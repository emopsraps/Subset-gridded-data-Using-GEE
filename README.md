# Overview

The EMOPS RAPS GIS team has now uploaded gridded data useful for risk analysis to its Google Earth Engine assets. To subset , check for the correct region ('UNICEF Reg' for a regional subset), country name ('adm0_name' for country specific subsets), or iso3 ('iso3') to defines your area of interest and matches the UNICEF shapefile. The list of UNICEF regions, country names, and iso3 are saved in this <a href="https://github.com/emopsraps/Subsets/blob/main/UNICEF_Geosight_Country_id.csv">document</a>. To subset the layers, click on this <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=users%2Femopsraps%2FScripts%3ASubset%20gridded%20data%20by%20country%20or%20region%2020240924">script</a>, make edits as needed and save your layers to your Google drive. Ensure that the UNICEF region, country name, <b>OR</b> iso3 is edited correctly or no subset will be returned.

## Quick tutorial on subsetting and downloading in the Google Earth Engine environment
A 2-page tutorial is shown in the slides saved here: <a href="https://github.com/emopsraps/Subset-gridded-data-Using-GEE/blob/main/Gridded%20data%20subset%20using%20GEE.pptx">here</a>. The list of layers available as Google Earth Engine assets are shown below:

To subset and download data in the Google Earth Engine environment, follow the quick diagram below. Do NOT edit any lines where the variables are predefined.
