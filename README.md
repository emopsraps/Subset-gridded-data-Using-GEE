# Overview

The EMOPS RAPS GIS team has now uploaded gridded data useful for risk analysis to its Google Earth Engine assets. To subset , check for the correct region ('UNICEF Reg' for a regional subset), country name ('adm0_name' for country specific subsets), or iso3 ('iso3') to define your area of interest as defined in the UNICEF shapefile. The list of UNICEF regions, country names, and iso3 are saved in this <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/c58bd5d15e4c7d8ee2ee4b118927cd9b">document</a>. To subset the layers, click on this <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/c58bd5d15e4c7d8ee2ee4b118927cd9b">script</a>, make edits as needed and save your layers to your Google drive.
